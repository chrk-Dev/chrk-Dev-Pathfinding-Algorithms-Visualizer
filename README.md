# Pathfinding Visualizer

A visual tool to demonstrate pathfinding algorithms using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project helps in understanding how various pathfinding algorithms work by visualizing the steps taken to find a path between two points in a grid.

## Features

-   **Algorithms**: Visualize popular pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, and more.
-   **Interactive Grid**: Create walls and move the start and end points to see how the algorithms adapt.
-   **Customizable**: Change grid size, speed of visualization, and algorithm settings.
-   **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes, thanks to Tailwind CSS.



## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    

    
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinding-visualizer.git
    cd pathfinding-visualizer` 
    
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    
 
    
    `npm install` 
    
3.  **Run the development server:**
    
    
    
    `npm run dev` 
    
    The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
    

## Usage

1.  **Select an algorithm**: Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2.  **Set up the grid**: Click on the grid to add walls, and drag the start and end points to desired positions.
3.  **Visualize**: Press the "Start" button to see the algorithm in action.
4.  **Adjust settings**: Use the controls to change the speed, grid size, and other settings.

## Technologies Used

-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
